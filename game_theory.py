    Game Theory is a field of mathematics that studies strategic interactions among rational decision-makers. 
    It provides a framework for analyzing situations where the outcome depends on the actions of multiple agents, 
    each with their own interests.

    Game theory, through the analysis of strategies, highlights key qualities that contribute to successful outcomes in repeated interactions. These qualities include being "Nice," "Forgiving," "Retaliatory," and "Clear." A strategy that embodies these qualities tends to foster trust, maintain cooperation, discourage exploitation, and create predictable interactions. For instance, a "Nice" strategy promotes initial cooperation, while "Forgiving" allows for the restoration of cooperation after conflict, preventing long-term grudges. Being "Retaliatory" ensures fairness by responding to defection, and "Clear" strategies help in establishing predictable and stable interactions.

    These qualities, which define good strategies in game theory, are equally applicable in real life. Being nice fosters goodwill, forgiveness maintains relationships despite occasional conflicts, retaliation prevents exploitation, and clarity builds trust and predictability. Thus, game theory not only provides insights into strategic interactions but also explains the moral behaviors that underpin successful human relationships.

    In the context of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD), players interact repeatedly over multiple rounds, 
    choosing between cooperation and defection. The game explores the consequences of these choices over time, 
    with various strategies exhibiting different behaviors.

    ### Rules of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma:
    1. **Players**: Two players interact repeatedly.
    2. **Choices**: In each round, each player can either:
       - Cooperate with the opponent
       - Defect with the opponent
    3. **Payoff Matrix**:
       - Both Cooperate: Each player gets 3 points.
       - Both Defect: Each player gets 1 point.
       - One Cooperates and the other Defects: The defector gets 5 points, and the cooperator gets 0 points.
